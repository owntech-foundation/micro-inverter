# An open-source - community built micro-inverter

## Manifesto 

The project goal are : 

- Having the first open source PV micro-inverter
- Finally a design easy to repair that is no longer a black box
- Redeem your data sovereignty, you will no longer depend on a proprietary cloud to follow your solar production and consumption. 

## Open, for everyone, forever

This project is propulsed by its community. 
The collective work generated is meant to remain open. 
In that sense, the owntech foundation aims at protecting this technical common.

## (ultra) Preliminary specifications

- 450W max per module
- no invasive potting that prevents reparability
